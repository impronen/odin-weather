# THOUGHTS

A great, fun project. The scope of the assignment only covers the use of weatherAPI but I wanted to take the project a bit further, with using the built in [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API). Similarly, took a detour to familiarise myself with the basics of responsive design, as I wanted the app to be usable by my friends and family, who mostly use mobile devices.

Learning about asynchronous code was challenging, as it required a totally different way to approach the basic building of applications. Weather thingy isn't ideal and the code has way too many close dependencies but for now, it is good enough.
